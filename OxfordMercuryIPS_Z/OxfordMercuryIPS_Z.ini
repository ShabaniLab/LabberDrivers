#   ...
#   state_value_n: Value of "state_quant" for which the control is visible
#   permission:    Sets read/writability, options are BOTH, READ, WRITE or NONE. Default is BOTH
#   set_cmd:       Command used to send data to the instrument. Put <*> where the value should appear.
#   get_cmd:       Command used to get the data from the instrument. Default is set_cmd?
#   sweep_cmd:     Command used to sweep data. Use <sr> for sweep rate, <st> for sweep time, and <*> for the value.
#   sweep_res:     Attainable resolution when sweeping an instrument
